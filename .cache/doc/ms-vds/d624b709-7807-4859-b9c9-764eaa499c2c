VDS_IPT_IPV4, this member contains the binary IPv4 address in network byte
order. The field 3 (last octet) byte value is contained in bits 0 through 7.
The byte value for field 2 is contained in bits 8 through 15. The byte value
for field 1 is contained in bits 16 through 23. The byte value for field 0 is
contained in bits 24 through 31. Otherwise, this value is ignored.</p><p><b>ipv6Address:</b>  If the type member is

order. Otherwise, this value is ignored.</p><p><b>ulIpv6FlowInfo:</b>  If the type member
is VDS_IPT_IPV6, this member contains the flow information as defined in IPv6.
Otherwise, this value is ignored.</p><p><b>ulIpv6ScopeId:</b>  If the type member
is VDS_IPT_IPV6, this member contains the scope ID as defined in IPv6.
Otherwise, this value is ignored.</p><p><b>wszTextAddress:</b>  If the type member
is VDS_IPT_TEXT, this member contains the null-terminated Unicode text address,
which is either a DNS address, an IPv4 dotted address, or an IPv6 hexadecimal
address. Otherwise, this value is ignored.</p><p><b>ulPort:</b>  If the type member is
VDS_IPT_IPV4, VDS_IPT_IPV6, or VDS_IPT_TEXT, this member contains the TCP port
number. Otherwise, this value is ignored.</p></div>
