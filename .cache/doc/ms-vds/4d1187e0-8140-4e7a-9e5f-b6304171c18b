<dd>
<p>A virtual disk created using the CREATE_
VIRTUAL_DISK_FLAG_NONE flag has a virtual disk file backing store that at any
given time is as large as the actual data written to it, plus the size of the
header and footer. As more data is written, the virtual disk file automatically
increases in size.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>For example, if the CREATE_VIRTUAL_DISK_FLAG_NONE
flag is used to create a virtual disk that is 2 gigabytes in size, the initial
size of the virtual disk file backing store can only be 2 megabytes. As data is
written to this disk, the virtual disk file backing store increases in size,
with a maximum size of 2 gigabytes.</p>
</dd></dl><p><b>CREATE_VIRTUAL_DISK_FLAG_FULL_PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION: 
</b>Specifies that the server preallocates all physical space necessary for the
virtual size of the virtual disk. A fixed size virtual disk file will be
allocated as the backing store for the virtual disk. For example, creating a
fixed size virtual disk that is 2 gigabytes in size using this flag will result
in a virtual disk file that is approximately 2 gigabytes in size.</p></div>
