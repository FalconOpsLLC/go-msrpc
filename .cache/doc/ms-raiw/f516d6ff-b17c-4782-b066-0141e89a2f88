<div class="content"><p>The Remote Administrative
Interface: WINS protocol is a client/server protocol that is used to remotely
configure, manage, and monitor the <a href="a83205a2-23e2-41bb-84e1-4d968aaae4e8#gt_f2f9c250-6c9e-445f-b677-376f23f77d87" data-linktype="relative-path">WINS server</a>. This protocol
allows a <a href="a83205a2-23e2-41bb-84e1-4d968aaae4e8#gt_60e0e1fa-66fe-41e1-b5e3-ceab97e53506" data-linktype="relative-path">client</a> to view
and update the server configuration settings as well as to create, modify, and
delete <a href="a83205a2-23e2-41bb-84e1-4d968aaae4e8#gt_bafb050b-b593-4517-8093-f721bd2378ac" data-linktype="relative-path">WINS</a> database
records. It also allows clients to trigger <a href="a83205a2-23e2-41bb-84e1-4d968aaae4e8#gt_345c3de7-adfa-4386-9ba5-f5f572af489c" data-linktype="relative-path">scavenging</a> and replicating
operations and to query the database.</p><p>The Remote Administrative Interface: WINS protocol is
stateless with no state shared across <a href="a83205a2-23e2-41bb-84e1-4d968aaae4e8#gt_8a7f6700-8311-45bc-af10-82e10accd331" data-linktype="relative-path">RPC</a> method calls. Each RPC
method call contains one complete request. Output from one method call can be
used as an input to another call, but the protocol does not provide methods for
locking the WINS server con figuration or state data across method calls. For
example, a client can pull a range of records from the database and delete some
of them using another RPC call. However, the protocol does not guarantee that
the specified record has not been modified by another client between the two
method calls.</p><table><thead>
