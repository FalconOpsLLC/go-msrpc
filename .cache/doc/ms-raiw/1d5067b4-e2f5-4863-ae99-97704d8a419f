immediately without waiting for the actual pull. It just queues a request for
the pull operation, and the actual pull starts at a time determined by the
current state and configuration of the target WINS server. Hence,
R_WinsPullRange callers SHOULD NOT treat an ERROR_SUCCESS return value as
indicating a successful pull operation. Instead, callers SHOULD rely on WINS
event logs to determine whether or not the pull operation succeeded. The
