<div class="content"><p>The Live Remote Event Capture (LREC) protocol allows a
client to connect to a server to monitor critical information and detect issues
as they occur on the server. For example, to detect under-provisioned servers,
an administrator can use this protocol to remotely see the <a href="59d7a0e2-342c-4dc3-bc27-88e9c4aa0415#gt_472f97f2-82ec-4623-8e46-d348a7984967" data-linktype="relative-path">events</a> that indicate
under-provisioning which are logged as high memory utilization. The remote
visibility into the event logging enables the administrator to re-balance the
load on the server, immediately observe the fix, and continue to make
improvements as necessary.</p><p>In the LREC protocol, information is sent over the network
to a client as a sequential stream of records each of which is referred to as
an event. Multiple software components and applications on the server can
report events using the protocol. These are referred to <a href="59d7a0e2-342c-4dc3-bc27-88e9c4aa0415#gt_9fc95e07-a7fc-4112-92f8-2842f54745e0" data-linktype="relative-path">event providers</a>. Each event
provider is identified by a unique &#34;provider ID&#34; and its event types
are described in a <a href="59d7a0e2-342c-4dc3-bc27-88e9c4aa0415#gt_7808f167-11e8-49ea-ac6d-e517a7fc7ae2" data-linktype="relative-path">provider
manifest</a> organized in any implementation-specific way, such as the XML
schema specified in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=299240" data-linktype="external">[MSDN-EvntManifest]</a>.
</p><p>Event providers can define multiple kinds of events. For example,
a user logging on could be one kind of event and a user logging off could be
another. When a provider reports an event, it specifies an event
provider-specific Event Type ID (referred to as an event ID) that indicates the
specific kind of event being reported. The event ID is reused whenever another
event of the same type is reported. Therefore, each event type is uniquely
identified by a provider ID and an event ID.</p><p>Different server configurations and application workloads
have varying requirements for monitoring and troubleshooting. To ensure
flexible support for these scenarios, multiple event providers can be added
into an event session to enable simultaneous event recording. When using
multiple event providers, two techniques in particular enable the broad
coverage of a session containing many event providers, yet narrow the number of
observed events:</p><ul><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>The server filters events based on the &#34;error level&#34; or
criticality of the events. </p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>The server filters events based on keywords, such as authentication,
input/output, or user interface. </p>
</li></ul><p>In the LREC protocol, an <a href="59d7a0e2-342c-4dc3-bc27-88e9c4aa0415#gt_61990ad1-68c5-4105-907f-d3acdafd5917" data-linktype="relative-path">event session</a> is configured
and started using a WS-Management-based control channel. When the session is
started, the server initializes an <a href="59d7a0e2-342c-4dc3-bc27-88e9c4aa0415#gt_8a7f6700-8311-45bc-af10-82e10accd331" data-linktype="relative-path">RPC</a> <a href="59d7a0e2-342c-4dc3-bc27-88e9c4aa0415#gt_b91c1e27-e8e0-499b-8c65-738006af72ee" data-linktype="relative-path">endpoint</a> and the client
connects to the server using the RPC endpoint to receive reported events. When
the client is finished observing reported events, the client stops the session
using the WS-Management-based control channel. When all event sessions are
stopped, the RPC endpoint is removed. </p></div>
