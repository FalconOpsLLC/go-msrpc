methods that perform configuration operations. The TASK_INFO structure provides
information about the task that is being performed by the server in response to
the request. The <b>id</b> member of this structure identifies this task from
all other tasks being performed by the server. Notifications received by the
client as a task progresses can be associated with the original request by
comparing the <b>taskId</b> member of the notification structure with the <b>id</b>
member of this structure. </p></div>
