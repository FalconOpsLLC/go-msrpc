</dd></dl><p><b>pwszScopeName:</b> A NULL-terminated Unicode
string containing the name of the zone scope, cache scope or server scope.</p><p><b>dwWeight:</b> A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies
the weight associated with the scope name. The weight of a scope determines the
number of responses that are sent from that scope. For example, if a
DNS_RPC_POLICY has pContentList with two <b>DNS_RPC_POLICY_CONTENT</b> items
having scope name and weight as {Scope1,2} and {Scope2,3}, then when the DNS
policy is a match, Scope1 is used to respond to the DNS operation for the first
two times the DNS policy is a match. Scope2 is used to respond to the DNS
operation for the next three times the DNS policy is a match. The sequence is
repeated for further matches of the DNS policy. If a <b>dwWeight</b> of a <b>DNS_RPC_POLICY_CONTENT</b>
is not given. its default weight is 1. So if two or more <b>DNS_RPC_POLICY_CONTENT</b>
structures are given during <b>DNS_RPC_POLICY</b> creation without a value for <b>dwWeight</b>,
all of them will get weight of 1 and the DNS operation will be performed from
each scope in a round-robin fashion. Allowed values for weight are any positive
number from 1 and higher to 0xFFFFFFFF. If 0 is sent as a weight, the DNS
server returns the error DNS_ERROR_POLICY_INVALID_WEIGHT (9981).</p></div>
