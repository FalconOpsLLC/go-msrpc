that specifies the SoftCompatibility capability of the server. This field MUST
be set to TRUE (1) to enable the SoftCompatibility feature, or it MUST be set
to FALSE (0) to disable the SoftCompatibility feature. The default value is
TRUE (1). This setting affects the open mode when the client does not have
read/write permission to the file it is accessing. If this feature is enabled,
the server uses share access (parameter to CreateFile) equal to FILE_SHARE_READ
and does not mark the open as compatibility mode open; otherwise, share access
is set equal to 0, and the open is marked as compatibility mode open.</p><p><b>sv599_enableforcedlogoff:</b>  A Boolean
that specifies whether or not the server forces a client to disconnect, even if
the client has open files, after the client&#39;s logon time has expired. This

TRUE (1).</p><p><b>sv599_timesource:</b>  A Boolean that
specifies whether the server is a reliable time source.</p><p><b>sv599_acceptdownlevelapis:</b>  A
Boolean that specifies whether the server accepts method calls from
previous-generation NTLM clients. This field MUST be set to TRUE (1) to enable
the server to accept method calls from previous-generation NTLM clients, or it

previous NTLM clients. The default value is TRUE (1). This field MUST be
ignored by the server on receipt.</p><p><b>sv599_lmannounce:</b>  A Boolean that
specifies whether the server is visible to NTLM 2.x clients. The default value
is FALSE (0). If this feature is enabled, the server announces its presence
through LanMan or NetBIOS announcements.</p><p><b>sv599_domain:</b>  A pointer to a
Unicode UTF character string that specifies the name of the server&#39;s domain.
This field cannot be modified by clients.</p><p><b>sv599_maxcopyreadlen:</b>  The server
MUST validate this value on receipt. The range of values MUST be from
0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF, inclusive. Due to historical reasons, the server does
not store this value. </p><p><b>sv599_maxcopywritelen:</b>  The server

300, inclusive.</p><p><b>sv599_minrcvqueue:</b>  Specifies the
minimum number of free receive work items that the server requires before it
begins to allocate more. The server keeps a pool of free work items for each
worker queue. When a new request is posted to this queue, a work item is picked
from the pool to hold that request while it is being processed. The work item
is returned to the pool after the processing is done. If the number of free
work items (that is, work items that are not being used to process a request)
for a queue falls below this setting, the server will request more work items
to be allocated for the queue. The range of values MUST be from 0 to 10,
inclusive.</p><p><b>sv599_minfreeworkitems:</b>  Specifies
the minimum number of available receive work items that the server requires to

The range of values MUST be from 10 to 180, inclusive.</p><p><b>sv599_oplockbreakresponsewait:</b>  Specifies
the period of time, in seconds, that the server waits for a client to respond
to an opportunistic lock break request from the server. For more information
about opportunistic locks, see [MS-CIFS] section 3.2.4.18. The range of values
MUST be from 10 to 180, inclusive.</p><p><b>sv599_enableoplocks:</b>  A Boolean that
specifies whether the server allows clients to use opportunistic locks on
files. Opportunistic locks are a significant performance enhancement, but they
have the potential to cause lost cached data on some networks, particularly
wide-area networks. For more information about opportunistic locks, see
[MS-CIFS] section 3.2.4.18. This field MUST be set to TRUE (1) to enable
clients to use opportunistic locks on files, or it MUST be set to FALSE (0) to
restrict clients from using opportunistic locks on files. The default value is
TRUE (1).</p><p><b>sv599_enableoplockforceclose:</b>  Unused.
MUST be set to zero and ignored on receipt.</p><p><b>sv599_enablefcbopens:</b>  Specifies
whether several MS-DOS File Control Blocks (FCBs) are placed in a single
location accessible to the server. If enabled, this option can save resources
on the server. This field MUST be set to TRUE (1) to place multiple MS-DOS FCBs
in a single location accessible to the server, and it MUST be set to FALSE (0)
otherwise. The default value is TRUE (1).</p><p><b>sv599_enableraw:</b>  Specifies whether
the server processes raw SMBs. If enabled, this allows more data to transfer
per transaction and improves performance. However, it is possible that
processing raw SMBs can impede performance on certain networks. This field MUST
be set to TRUE (1) to indicate that the server processes raw SMBs, and it MUST
be set to FALSE (0) to indicate that the server does not process raw SMBs. The
server MUST maintain the value of this member. The default value is TRUE (1).</p><p><b>sv599_enablesharednetdrives:</b>  Specifies

time, in minutes, between two invocations of an implementation-specific
algorithm on the server. This algorithm monitors server errors and disk space
limits, and it generates the implementation-specific failure events. The range
of values MUST be from 1 to 65,535, inclusive.</p><p><b>sv599_errorthreshold:</b>  Specifies the
number of failed operations (non-network) that the server logs before raising
