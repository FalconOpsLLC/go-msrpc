<div class="content"><p>The Microsoft Telephony Application Programming Interface
(TAPI) enables implementation of communications applications ranging from voice
mail to call centers with multiple agents and switches. The Microsoft Telephony
programming model abstracts communications control from device control, freeing
end-user applications and device manufacturers from the need to conform to the
others&#39; requirements. Using this model, an end-user or server application does
not require detailed information about device control and the device does not
need to be tailored to the application. Applications and devices can undergo
innovation and change independently. Possible TAPI applications can include:</p><ul><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Basic voice calls on the public switched telephone network
(PSTN).</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Call center applications for tracking multiple agents.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Private branch exchange (PBX) control.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Interactive voice response (IVR) computing systems.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Voice mail.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Detailed phone device control.</p>
