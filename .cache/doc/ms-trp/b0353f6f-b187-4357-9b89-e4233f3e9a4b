</tbody></table><p><b>TokenRate (4 bytes): </b>An unsigned 32-bit
integer. Specifies the permitted rate at which data can be transmitted over the
life of the flow. </p><p><b>TokenBucketSize (4 bytes): </b>An unsigned 32-bit
integer. The maximum amount of credits, in bytes, that a particular direction
of a flow can accrue, regardless of time. </p><p><b>PeakBandwidth (4 bytes): </b>An unsigned 32-bit
integer. The upper limit, in bytes per second, on time-based transmission
permission for a particular flow. <b>PeakBandwidth</b> restricts flows that can
have accrued a significant amount of transmission credits, or tokens from
overburdening network resources with one-time or cyclical data bursts, by
enforcing a per-second data transmission ceiling. Some intermediate systems can
take advantage of this information, resulting in more efficient resource
allocation. </p><p><b>Latency (4 bytes): </b>An unsigned 32-bit integer.
The maximum acceptable delay, in microseconds, between transmission of a bit by
the sender and its receipt by one or more intended receivers. The precise
interpretation of this number depends on the level of guarantee that is
specified in the QoS request. </p><p><b>DelayVariation (4 bytes): </b>An unsigned 32-bit
integer. The difference between the maximum and minimum possible delay, in
microseconds, that a packet will experience. <b>DelayVariation</b> is used to
determine the amount of packet space that is needed at the receiving end of the
flow. This packet space information can be used to restore the original data
transmission pattern. </p><p><b>ServiceType (4 bytes): </b>An unsigned 32-bit
integer. Specifies the level of service to negotiate for the flow. </p><dl>
