<div class="content"><p> </p><p>The Distributed Link Tracking: Central Manager Protocol is
based on the Remote Procedure Call Protocol Extensions, as specified in <span><a href="../ms-rpce/290c38b1-92fe-4229-91e6-4fc376610c15" data-linktype="relative-path">[MS-RPCE]</a></span>.
The primary purpose of this protocol is to allow clients of the Distributed
Link Tracking: Workstation Protocol to determine the correct server to contact
when searching for a file. To accomplish this, the Distributed Link Tracking
(DLT) Central Manager server accepts notifications of file and <span><a href="a45c8c1a-fb81-4a65-a3f1-82d471da2197#gt_9a876829-33a1-4f0b-8b81-8552b7e5561c" data-linktype="relative-path">volume</a></span>
moves, in addition to other relevant information from participating computers.
This information can be queried by clients to get the file&#39;s current location
in <span><a href="a45c8c1a-fb81-4a65-a3f1-82d471da2197#gt_c9507dca-291d-4fd6-9cba-a9ee7da8c908" data-linktype="relative-path">UNC</a></span>
form.</p><p>The following is a scenario of this protocol working
together with the Distributed Link Tracking: Workstation Protocol:</p><ul><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>A file is created on computer M1. M1 assigns identifiers,
specifically <span><a href="a45c8c1a-fb81-4a65-a3f1-82d471da2197#gt_3b097896-b707-47b5-b1bb-384867a453ea" data-linktype="relative-path">FileID</a></span> and <span><a href="a45c8c1a-fb81-4a65-a3f1-82d471da2197#gt_d0fe4e63-48a5-4d63-9d51-d4f99306046e" data-linktype="relative-path">FileLocation</a></span>,
to the file.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Computer M0 makes note of the file, locally storing its identifiers.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>The file is moved from computer M1 to M2 and from there to M3. In
conjunction with these moves, the file maintains its FileID value, but a new
FileLocation identifier is assigned.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>To find the file in its new location, M0 contacts a DLT Central
Manager server to query the current location of the file.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>The DLT Central Manager server queries its tables, and determines
that the file is currently on computer M3.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>M0 contacts the Distributed Link Tracking: Central Manager
Protocol on M3, and learns the file&#39;s new name and location.</p>
</li></ul><p>The following diagram shows the machine configuration for
this example. The list after the diagram walks through the scenario, and
describes in more detail how the Distributed Link Tracking: Central Manager
Protocol is used.</p><p><img id="MS-DLTM_pictc971091c-1eaa-7b33-303b-7f26c5128d49.png" src="ms-dltm_files/image001.png" alt="Distributed Link Tracking (DLT) process" title="Distributed Link Tracking (DLT) process" data-linktype="relative-path"/></p><p><b>Figure 1: Distributed Link Tracking (DLT) process</b></p><ul><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>A file named F1.txt starts on a computer with <span><a href="a45c8c1a-fb81-4a65-a3f1-82d471da2197#gt_e15432dc-30dd-4e3d-8757-19b639769c95" data-linktype="relative-path">MachineID</a></span>
M1, on a volume with <span><a href="a45c8c1a-fb81-4a65-a3f1-82d471da2197#gt_3b3c1be2-035c-4823-afeb-10edbd6bb288" data-linktype="relative-path">VolumeID</a></span> V1, and
with an <span><a href="a45c8c1a-fb81-4a65-a3f1-82d471da2197#gt_4d73c422-8089-444c-a40a-64511c1a3b75" data-linktype="relative-path">ObjectID</a></span> of O1. </p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>The file is first moved to a computer with MachineID M2. On M2,
the file has a new name, F2.txt, and a new ObjectID of O2. The volume on that
computer has a VolumeID of V2. </p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>M1 sends a notification to the DLT Central Manager server
indicating that the file with FileLocation V1O1 and FileID V1O1 has been moved
to M2, where it now has the FileLocation V2O2.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>The file is next moved to computer M3. On that computer, the file
has the name F3.txt, and new ObjectID O3. The volume on that computer has a
VolumeID of V3.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>M2 sends a notification to the DLT Central Manager server
indicating that the file with FileLocation V2O2 and FileID V1O1 has been moved
to M3, where it now has the FileLocation V3O3. Note that this notification is
sent to the same DLT Central Manager server instance as the notification from
M1.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Before the file is moved, a user on computer M0 requests that
information about the file be saved, so that its location can be determined
after it has been moved.<a id="Appendix_A_Target_1"></a><a aria-label="Product behavior note 1" href="e89fb7a4-4550-40c5-91e8-94a66665b499#Appendix_A_1" data-linktype="relative-path">&lt;1&gt;</a> As a result,
M0 stores the UNC, the MachineID, the FileLocation, and the FileID.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>After the file has been moved both times, and after M0 attempts
to open the file, the DLT <span><a href="a45c8c1a-fb81-4a65-a3f1-82d471da2197#gt_8d715ee8-6e10-41fd-b452-39f6014de7ed" data-linktype="relative-path">Workstation</a></span> client
on M0 sends a query to the DLT Workstation server on M1, requesting the new UNC
for the file with FileID V1O1.<a id="Appendix_A_Target_2"></a><a aria-label="Product behavior note 2" href="e89fb7a4-4550-40c5-91e8-94a66665b499#Appendix_A_2" data-linktype="relative-path">&lt;2&gt;</a> That server
responds that the file has been moved to M2, with a new FileLocation of V2O2.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Rather than contacting M2, M0 then sends a request to a DLT
Central Manager server. Note that this is the same server that received the
move notifications from M1 and M2, or a server instance that shares tables with
the servers that received those notifications.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>The DLT Central Manager server returns the file&#39;s current
information, according to its tables, that the file is now on computer M3, with
FileLocation V3O3.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>M0 then makes a request to the DLT Workstation server on M3,
which indicates that the file now has the UNC &#34;\\M3\share\F3.txt&#34;.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>M0 updates its store of information for the file with these
updated UNC and FileLocation values.<a id="Appendix_A_Target_3"></a><a aria-label="Product behavior note 3" href="e89fb7a4-4550-40c5-91e8-94a66665b499#Appendix_A_3" data-linktype="relative-path">&lt;3&gt;</a></p>
