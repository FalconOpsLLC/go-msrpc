consists of two protocols that work together to discover the new location of a
file that has moved. <span><a href="a45c8c1a-fb81-4a65-a3f1-82d471da2197#gt_51f062a5-c727-4025-bb61-1568b94d38cd" data-linktype="relative-path">DLT</a></span> can determine
whether the file has moved on a mass-storage device, within a computer, or between
computers in a network. In addition to the Distributed Link Tracking: Central
Manager Protocol, DLT includes the Distributed Link Tracking: Workstation
Protocol, as specified in <span><a href="../ms-dltw/fc649f0e-871a-431a-88b5-d5b2f80e9cc9" data-linktype="relative-path">[MS-DLTW]</a></span>,
which is used to determine a file&#39;s current location. Both DLT protocols are <span><a href="a45c8c1a-fb81-4a65-a3f1-82d471da2197#gt_8a7f6700-8311-45bc-af10-82e10accd331" data-linktype="relative-path">remote
