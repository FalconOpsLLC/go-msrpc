FsrmQuotaFlags_Enforce bitmask is set as part of the <i>QuotaFlags</i> property
of an <b>IFsrmQuotaBase</b> object, the server fails an I/O operation that
causes the disk space usage to exceed the quota limit. If not set, the server
does not fail operations that violate the I/O limit, but still run actions
associated with the quota limit.</p><p><b>FsrmQuotaFlags_Disable:  </b>If the
FsrmQuotaFlags_Disable bitmask is set as part of the <i>QuotaFlags</i> property
of an <b>IFsrmQuotaBase</b> object, the server does not track quota data for
the quota and does not run any actions associated with quota thresholds.</p><p><b>FsrmQuotaFlags_StatusIncomplete:  </b>If the
FsrmQuotaFlags_StatusIncomplete bitmask is set as part of the <i>QuotaFlags</i>
property of an <b>IFsrmQuotaBase</b> object, a quota is defined on the server
but the rebuilding procedure has not yet started.</p><p><b>FsrmQuotaFlags_StatusRebuilding:  </b>If the
FsrmQuotaFlags_StatusRebuilding bitmask is set as part of the <i>QuotaFlags</i>
property of an <b>IFsrmQuotaBase</b> object, a quota is rebuilding its data
from the disk.</p></div>
