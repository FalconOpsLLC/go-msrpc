Link Tracking (DLT)</a> consists of two protocols that work together to
discover the new location of a file that has moved. <a href="87473ab8-f8a9-468d-8210-cd1d1522de42#gt_51f062a5-c727-4025-bb61-1568b94d38cd" data-linktype="relative-path">DLT</a> can determine if the
file has moved on a mass-storage device, within a computer, or between computers
in a network. The Distributed Link Tracking: Workstation Protocol helps a
computer locate files that have been moved within a computer or between
computers in a computer network.</p><p>In addition to the Distributed Link Tracking: Workstation
Protocol, DLT includes the Distributed Link Tracking: Central Manager Protocol
that keeps track of file and <a href="87473ab8-f8a9-468d-8210-cd1d1522de42#gt_9a876829-33a1-4f0b-8b81-8552b7e5561c" data-linktype="relative-path">volume</a>
moves as well as other relevant information from participating computers so it
can provide this information in response to <a href="87473ab8-f8a9-468d-8210-cd1d1522de42#gt_8d715ee8-6e10-41fd-b452-39f6014de7ed" data-linktype="relative-path">workstation</a> queries. Both
DLT protocols are <a href="87473ab8-f8a9-468d-8210-cd1d1522de42#gt_8a7f6700-8311-45bc-af10-82e10accd331" data-linktype="relative-path">remote
