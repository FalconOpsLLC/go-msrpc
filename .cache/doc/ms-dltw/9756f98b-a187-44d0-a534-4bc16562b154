but the file has been moved to a new computer, the server might be able to
return the MachineID of the computer to which the file was moved, so that the
client can contact the DLT Workstation server on the new computer to get the
file&#39;s current UNC and FileLocation, or another referral. This process of
following referrals continues until a server returns the file&#39;s UNC name and FileLocation,
or an error.</p><p>Rather than following referrals in this manner, a client can
use the Distributed Link Tracking: Central Manager Protocol to determine a
file&#39;s current MachineID and FileLocation, and then use that information to
initiate a call to the DLT Workstation server on the computer indicated by that
MachineID. For more information on using the Distributed Link Tracking: Central
Manager Protocol in combination with the Distributed Link Tracking: Workstation
Protocol, see <a href="../ms-dltm/a4a88aac-3bc5-4d5a-8136-52a3bfb979ef" data-linktype="relative-path">[MS-DLTM]</a>.</p><p>The following is a scenario that describes the <a href="87473ab8-f8a9-468d-8210-cd1d1522de42#gt_51f062a5-c727-4025-bb61-1568b94d38cd" data-linktype="relative-path">DLT</a> protocols working together:</p><ol><li><p><span>    </span>A file is
created on computer M1. M1 assigns identifiers, specifically FileID and
FileLocation, to the file.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>Computer M0
takes note of the file, locally storing its identifiers.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>The file is
moved from computer M1 to M2 and from there to M3. In concert with these moves,
the file maintains its FileID but gets a new FileLocation assigned.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>If the
Distributed Link Tracking: Central Manager Protocol is used, clients on
computers M1 and M2 notify the server that the file has been moved, indicating
the file&#39;s FileID and its old and new FileLocation values.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>Computer M0
finds the file in its new location in one of two ways:</p>
<ol><li><p><span>   
</span>Using only the Distributed Link Tracking: Workstation Protocol:</p>
<ul><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>M0 contacts M1, using the identifiers stored previously, and
learns that the file was moved to M2.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>M0 contacts M2 and learns that the file was moved to M3.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>M0 contacts M3 and learns the file&#39;s new name and location.</p>
</li></ul></li><li><p><span>   
</span>Using both the Distributed Link Tracking: Workstation Protocol and the
Distributed Link Tracking: Central Manager Protocol:</p>
<ul><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>M0 contacts a DLT Central Manager server to query the current
location of the file.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>The server queries its tables and determines that the file is
currently on computer M3.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>M0 contacts the DLT Workstation client on M3 and learns the
file&#39;s new name and location.</p>
</li></ul></li></ol></li></ol><p>The following is an example of a file being moved between
computers, and shows in more detail how to use the Distributed Link Tracking:
Workstation Protocol to determine the file&#39;s new location. In this example,
only the Distributed Link Tracking: Workstation Protocol is used, without using
the Distributed Link Tracking: Central Manager Protocol.</p><ol><li><p><span>    </span>In the initial
state, a file is located on a computer named M1. Assume that the file is named
&#34;F1.txt&#34;, and can be located via the UNC &#34;\\M1\share1\F1.txt&#34;.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>Before the file
is moved, a user on computer M0 requests that information about the file be
saved,<a id="Appendix_A_Target_1"></a><a aria-label="Product behavior note 1" href="caa74a29-27fb-4f50-afa5-bbf152fe5d27#Appendix_A_1" data-linktype="relative-path">&lt;1&gt;</a> so that its location can be
determined after it has been moved. As a result, M0 stores the UNC, the
MachineID, the FileLocation, and the FileID.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>The file is
moved from machine M1 to machine M2; for example, to the UNC
&#34;\\M2\share2\F2.txt&#34;. M1 stores the file&#39;s old FileLocation and
FileID, as well as the file&#39;s new FileLocation and MachineID.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>When M0 attempts
to open the file<a id="Appendix_A_Target_2"></a><a aria-label="Product behavior note 2" href="caa74a29-27fb-4f50-afa5-bbf152fe5d27#Appendix_A_2" data-linktype="relative-path">&lt;2&gt;</a> by using the UNC
&#34;\\M1\share1\F1.txt&#34;, it receives a file-not-found error message. M0
then initiates a call to the DLT Workstation server on M1 with the previously
stored FileID and FileLocation of the file.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>The DLT
Workstation server on M1 returns to the DLT Workstation client on M0 that the
file was moved, and specifies the MachineID of the file&#39;s new location (M2), as
well as the file&#39;s new FileLocation value.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>M0 then repeats
the call, but this time to the DLT Workstation server on M2 with the new
FileLocation value.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>The DLT
Workstation server on M2 returns to the DLT Workstation client on M0 the file&#39;s
new UNC, &#34;\\M2\share2\F2.txt&#34;.</p>
</li><li><p><span>    </span>The DLT
Workstation client on M0 then updates its stored values with the updated UNC
and FileLocation values.</p>
