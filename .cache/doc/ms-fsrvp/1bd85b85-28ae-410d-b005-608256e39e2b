<div class="content"><p>The File Server Remote VSS Protocol is designed to remotely
create shadow copies of file shares hosted on a file server. This facilitates

server-side implementation can be integrated with existing volume <a href="0856b278-46f4-4f3e-bc06-bc382b26428b#gt_34537940-5a56-4122-b6ff-b9a4d065d066" data-linktype="relative-path">shadow copy</a> creation
