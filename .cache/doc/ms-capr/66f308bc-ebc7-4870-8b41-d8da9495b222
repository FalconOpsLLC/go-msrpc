<div class="content"><p>The Central Access Policy ID Retrieval (CAPR) Protocol is
designed to allow an administrative tool running on one computer to remotely
query the set of central access control policies configured on another
computer. </p><p>Central access policy objects are created in Active
Directory using administrative authorization tools. Selected central access
policy objects are deployed to other computers using Group Policy: Central
Access Policies Extension (CAPE, described in <a href="../ms-gpcap/5189d5c9-12c2-491c-bf16-f7008c46c6fb" data-linktype="relative-path">[MS-GPCAP]</a>).
Other administrative tools can then use CAPR to determine which central policy
objects have been deployed to a given remote computer.</p><p>Within CAPE and CAPR, central access policies are
represented by Central Access Policy IDs (CAPIDs). A CAPID is simply the SID of
a central access policy object within Active Directory.</p><p>The typical use scenario is as follows. An administrative
interface tool uses CAPR to obtain the CAPIDs of one or more central access
policy objects. The tool then uses these CAPIDs with CAPE and Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP): The Protocol, specified in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=157505" data-linktype="external">[RFC4511]</a>, to obtain
detailed information about the policies. That data can then be presented to the
user and manipulated in whatever manner is appropriate to the administrative
interface tool, such as to perform authorization tasks.</p><p>This protocol defines one RPC call, LsarGetAvailableCAPIDs,
for client applications to use. See section <a href="c10f1549-4710-4e93-9689-abcb1cfa45ef" data-linktype="relative-path">3.1.4.1</a> for details of
this call&#39;s use. </p></div>
