that specifies whether to delay the start of the service. If this value is
TRUE, the service is started after other autostart services are started plus a
short delay of approximately two minutes. Otherwise, the service is started
during the system boot. This setting is ignored unless the service is an
autostart service.</p><p>If the service has other services that it is dependent on,
as specified via the <b>lpDependencies</b> member of the QUERY_SERVICE_CONFIGA
