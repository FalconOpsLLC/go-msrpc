<div class="content"><p>This specification for encoding extended error information
assumes that the reader has familiarity with the concepts and the requirements
that are detailed in <a href="../ms-rpce/290c38b1-92fe-4229-91e6-4fc376610c15" data-linktype="relative-path">[MS-RPCE]</a>
and <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89824" data-linktype="external">[C706]</a>.</p><p>The purpose of the encoding that this specification defines
is to allow a software agent on one network node to communicate a rich (or
extended) error to a software agent on another network node. This specification
does not define how an extended error is transmitted between network nodes. A
protocol outside this specification is used for that purpose. This specification
only defines the encoding rules for an extended error.</p><p>Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All
other sections and examples in this specification are informative.</p></div>
