being enforced. This symbolic constant has a value of 1.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_WF_OFF_IN_PROFILE:  </b>The
object is not being enforced because the firewall and advanced security
component is not active in a profile where the object is meant to be applied.
This symbolic constant has a value of 2.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_CATEGORY_OFF:  </b>The object
is not being enforced because a third-party software component registered with
the firewall and advanced security component to own the functionality that the
object is meant to perform. This symbolic constant has a value of 3.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_DISABLED_OBJECT:  </b>The
object is not being enforced because the object is disabled. This symbolic
constant has a value of 4.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_INACTIVE_PROFILE:  </b>The
object is not being enforced because at least one of the profiles that the
object is meant to be applied to is not currently active. This symbolic
constant has a value of 5.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_LOCAL_ADDRESS_RESOLUTION_EMPTY:

object contains a keyword that resolves to an empty set. This symbolic constant
has a value of 9.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_INTERFACE_RESOLUTION_EMPTY:  </b>The

contains a keyword that resolves to an empty set. This symbolic constant has a
value of 10.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_APPLICATION_RESOLUTION_EMPTY: 
</b>The object is not being enforced because the application condition of the
object contains a path that could not resolve to a valid file system path. This
symbolic constant has a value of 11.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_REMOTE_MACHINE_EMPTY:  </b>The
object is not being enforced because the remote machine condition of the object
contains an SDDL with a <span><a href="d891304d-92d8-4f9f-9e60-a1f02b28ae30#gt_83f2020d-0804-4840-a5ac-e06439d50f8d" data-linktype="relative-path">security identifier (SID)</a></span>

of 12.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_REMOTE_USER_EMPTY:  </b>The

contains an SDDL with a SID that is not currently available on the host. This
symbolic constant has a value of 13.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_LOCAL_GLOBAL_OPEN_PORTS_DISALLOWED: 
</b>The object is not being enforced because the
FW_PROFILE_CONFIG_AUTH_APPS_ALLOW_USER_PREF_MERGE configuration option (see
section <span><a href="5a6e0d39-802d-456b-b483-c7360566fcdd" data-linktype="relative-path">2.2.38</a></span> for more
details) from a profile that the object applied to, disallowed its use. This
symbolic constant has a value of 14.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_LOCAL_AUTHORIZED_APPLICATIONS_DISALLOWED: 
</b>The object is not being enforced because the
FW_PROFILE_CONFIG_GLOBAL_PORTS_ALLOW_USER_PREF_MERGE configuration option (see
section 2.2.38 for more details) from a profile that the object applied to,
disallowed its use. This symbolic constant has a value of 15.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_LOCAL_FIREWALL_RULES_DISALLOWED: 
</b>The object is not being enforced because the
FW_PROFILE_CONFIG_ALLOW_LOCAL_POLICY_MERGE configuration option (see section
2.2.38 for more details) from a profile that the object applied to, disallowed
its use. This symbolic constant has a value of 16.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_LOCAL_CONSEC_RULES_DISALLOWED: 
</b>The object is not being enforced because the
FW_PROFILE_CONFIG_ALLOW_LOCAL_IPSEC_POLICY_MERGE configuration option (see
section 2.2.38 for more details) from a profile that the object applied to,
disallowed its use. This symbolic constant has a value of 17.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_MISMATCHED_PLATFORM:  </b>The
object is not being enforced because the platform validity condition does not
match the current platform of the host. This symbolic constant has a value of
18.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_OPTIMIZED_OUT:  </b>The
object is not being enforced because the firewall and advanced security
component determined that the object-implemented functionality is irrelevant
(would not change or affect what traffic is allowed or permitted) at the
current time. Therefore, the component optimized out the irrelevant
functionality and ignored it. This is a pure optimization. This symbolic
constant has a value of 19.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_LOCAL_USER_EMPTY:  </b>The
object is not being enforced, because the local user condition of the object
contains an SDDL with a SID that is not currently available on the host. For
schema versions 0x0200, 0x0201, and 0x020A, this value is invalid and MUST NOT
be used. This symbolic constant has a value of 20.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_TRANSPORT_MACHINE_SD_EMPTY:  </b>The
object is not being enforced because the <span><a href="d891304d-92d8-4f9f-9e60-a1f02b28ae30#gt_f8a5b7f0-25e0-4c81-9abf-00b56a580deb" data-linktype="relative-path">IPsec</a></span> transport mode
machine authorization list contains an SDDL with a SID that is not currently
available on the host. For schema versions 0x0200, 0x0201, and 0x020A, this
value is invalid and MUST NOT be used. This symbolic constant has a value of
21.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_TRANSPORT_USER_SD_EMPTY:  </b>The
object is not being enforced, because the IPsec transport mode user
authorization list contains an SDDL with a SID that is not currently available
on the host. For schema versions 0x0200, 0x0201, and 0x020A, this value is
invalid and MUST NOT be used. This symbolic constant has a value of 22.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_TUPLE_RESOLUTION_EMPTY:  </b>The
object is not being enforced, because the trust tuple keywords resolve to an
empty set. For schema versions 0x0200, 0x0201, and 0x020A, this value is
invalid and MUST NOT be used. This symbolic constant has a value of 23.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_DUPLICATE:</b> This object is
not enforced because the Firewall and Advanced Security component determined
that the object is a duplicate of an already enforced object and is therefore
irrelevant, as it would not change or affect traffic that is otherwise allowed
or permitted. Therefore, the component essentially optimized-out the irrelevant
functionality by ignoring it. This is a pure optimization. This symbolic
constant has a value of 24.</p><p><b>FW_ENFORCEMENT_STATE_MAX:  </b>This value and
values that exceed this value are not valid and MUST NOT be used. It is defined
for simplicity in writing IDL definitions and code. This symbolic constant has
a value of 25.</p></div>
