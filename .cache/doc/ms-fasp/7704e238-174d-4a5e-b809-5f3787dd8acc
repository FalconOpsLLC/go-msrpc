<div class="content"><p> </p><p>This data type defines the enumerations that are used to
identify profile types. The enumeration values are bitmasks. Implementations
MUST support using a single bitmask value and MUST support a combination of
bitmask values. Valid combinations of bitmask values are all possible
combinations using FW_PROFILE_TYPE_DOMAIN, FW_PROFILE_TYPE_PRIVATE,
FW_PROFILE_TYPE_PUBLIC, and FW_PROFILE_TYPE_ALL. A profile is a set of networks
to which a firewall policy might apply.</p><dl>

definitions and code.</p><p><b>FW_PROFILE_TYPE_DOMAIN:  </b>This value represents
the profile for networks that are connected to domains.</p><p><b>FW_PROFILE_TYPE_STANDARD:  </b>This value
represents the standard profile for networks. These networks are classified as
private by the administrators in the server host. The classification happens
the first time the host connects to the network. Usually these networks are
behind Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, routers, and other edge
devices, and they are in a private location, such as a home or an office.</p><p><b>FW_PROFILE_TYPE_PRIVATE:  </b>This value
represents the profile for private networks, which is represented by the same
value as that used for FW_PROFILE_TYPE_STANDARD.</p><p><b>FW_PROFILE_TYPE_PUBLIC:  </b>This value represents
the profile for public networks. These networks are classified as public by the
administrators in the server host. The classification happens the first time
the host connects to the network. Usually these networks are those at airports,
coffee shops, and other public places where the peers in the network or the
network administrator are not trusted.</p><p><b>FW_PROFILE_TYPE_ALL:  </b>This value represents
all these network sets and any future network sets.</p><p><b>FW_PROFILE_TYPE_CURRENT:  </b>This value
represents the current profiles to which the firewall and advanced security
components determine the host is connected at the moment of the call. This
value can be specified only in method calls, and it cannot be combined with
other flags. </p><p><b>FW_PROFILE_TYPE_NONE:  </b>This value represents
no profile and is invalid. It is defined for simplicity in writing IDL
definitions and code. This and greater values MUST NOT be used.</p></div>
