functionality represents the policy that is used while the system is starting
up and the firewall and advance security component is not yet running. This
symbolic constant has a value of 0.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_CATEGORY_STEALTH:  </b>This category of
functionality represents the policy that is used to make the system appear
invisible when it is connected to a network. For example, this functionality
helps prevent attackers from discovering the host and the ports that open to
the host. This symbolic constant has a value of 1.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_CATEGORY_FIREWALL:  </b>This category of functionality
represents functions that are performed by firewall objects while they are
present on the FW_STORE_TYPE_LOCAL, FW_STORE_TYPE_DYNAMIC, and
FW_STORE_TYPE_GP_RSOP policy stores (see section <span><a href="37ebed95-8abf-472c-8b4b-7a510a2a6baa" data-linktype="relative-path">2.2.1</a></span>). This
symbolic constant has a value of 2.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_CATEGORY_CONSEC:  </b>This category of
functionality represents functions that are performed by the connection
security objects. This symbolic constant has a value of 3.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_CATEGORY_MAX:  </b>This value and values
that exceed this value are not valid and MUST NOT be used. It is defined for
