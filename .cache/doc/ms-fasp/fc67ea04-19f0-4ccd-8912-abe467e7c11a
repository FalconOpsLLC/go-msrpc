none of the following flags are set. It is defined for simplicity in writing <span><a href="d891304d-92d8-4f9f-9e60-a1f02b28ae30#gt_73177eec-4092-420f-92c5-60b2478df824" data-linktype="relative-path">IDL</a></span>
definitions and code.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_ACTIVE:  </b>The rule is enabled if
this flag is set; otherwise, it is disabled.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATE:  </b>This flag MUST be
set only on rules that have the allow actions. If set, traffic that matches the
rule is allowed only if it has been authenticated by <span><a href="d891304d-92d8-4f9f-9e60-a1f02b28ae30#gt_f8a5b7f0-25e0-4c81-9abf-00b56a580deb" data-linktype="relative-path">IPsec</a></span>; otherwise,
traffic is blocked.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATE_WITH_ENCRYPTION:  </b>This
flag is similar to the FW_RULE_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATE flag; however, traffic MUST
also be encrypted.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_ROUTEABLE_ADDRS_TRAVERSE:  </b>This
flag MUST be set only on inbound rules. This flag allows the matching traffic to
traverse a NAT edge device and be allowed in the host computer.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_LOOSE_SOURCE_MAPPED:  </b>This flag
allows responses from a remote IP address that is different from the one to
which the outbound matched traffic originally went.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_AUTH_WITH_NO_ENCAPSULATION:  </b>This
flag MUST be set only on rules that have the FW_RULE_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATE flag
set. If set, traffic that matches the rule is allowed if <span><a href="d891304d-92d8-4f9f-9e60-a1f02b28ae30#gt_294fef97-5790-4d41-971e-dd255b783e68" data-linktype="relative-path">IKE</a></span>
or <span><a href="d891304d-92d8-4f9f-9e60-a1f02b28ae30#gt_3791f3e1-cf2f-4605-9fcc-54f526f036cf" data-linktype="relative-path">AuthIP</a></span>
authentication was successful; however, this flag does not necessarily require
that traffic be protected by IPsec encapsulations. For schema versions 0x0200
and 0x0201, this value is invalid and MUST NOT be used.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_AUTH_WITH_ENC_NEGOTIATE:  </b>This
flag MUST be set only on inbound rules that have the
FW_RULE_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATE_WITH_ENCRYPTION flag set. If set and if the first
packet that arrives is unencrypted but authenticated by IPsec, the packet is
allowed, and an IKE or AuthIP negotiation is started to negotiate encryption
settings and encrypt subsequent packets. <span><a href="../ms-aips/eee3de64-3847-4451-978e-9513ff187d30" data-linktype="relative-path">[MS-AIPS]</a></span>
section <span><a href="../ms-aips/ef990335-6f13-43b7-8f50-3dee52d096e0" data-linktype="relative-path">3.2.4</a></span>
specifies negotiation initiation behavior for hosts that support both IKE and
AuthIP negotiation. If the negotiation fails, the connection is dropped. For
schema versions 0x0200 and 0x0201, this value is invalid and MUST NOT be used.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_ROUTEABLE_ADDRS_TRAVERSE_DEFER_APP: 
</b>This flag MUST be set only on inbound rules. This flag allows the matching
traffic to traverse a NAT edge device and be allowed in the host computer, if
and only if a matching <b>PortInUse</b> object is found in the <b>PortsInUse</b>
collection with <b>NATTraversalRequested</b> set to true (see section <span><a href="43507d53-8955-416d-b913-dfb27dc76b17" data-linktype="relative-path">3.1.1</a></span>).
For schema versions 0x0200 and 0x0201, this value is invalid and MUST NOT be
used.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_ROUTEABLE_ADDRS_TRAVERSE_DEFER_USER: 
</b>This flag MUST be set only on inbound rules. Whenever an application tries
to listen for traffic that matches this rule, the operating system asks the
administrator of the host whether it should allow this traffic to traverse the
NAT. For schema versions 0x0200 and 0x0201, this value is invalid and MUST NOT
be used.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATE_BYPASS_OUTBOUND:  </b>This
flag MUST be set only on outbound rules that have an allow action with either
the FW_RULE_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATE or the
FW_RULE_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATE_WITH_ENCRYPTION flag set. If set, this rule is
evaluated before block rules, making it equivalent to a rule with an
FW_RULE_ACTION_ALLOW_BYPASS, but for outbound. For schema versions 0x0200 and 0x0201,
this value is invalid and MUST NOT be used.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_ALLOW_PROFILE_CROSSING:  </b>This
flag allows responses from a network with a different profile type than the
network to which the outbound traffic was originally sent. This flag MUST be
ignored on rules with an action of FW_RULE_ACTION_BLOCK. For schema versions
0x0200, 0x0201, and 0x020A, this value is invalid and MUST NOT be used.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_LOCAL_ONLY_MAPPED:  </b>If this flag
is set on a rule, the remote address and remote port conditions are ignored
when determining whether a network traffic flow matches the rule. This flag
MUST be ignored on rules with an action of FW_RULE_ACTION_BLOCK. For schema
versions 0x0200, 0x0201, and 0x020A, this value is invalid and MUST NOT be
used.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_MAX:  </b>This value and values that
exceed this value are not valid and MUST NOT be used. It is defined for
simplicity in writing IDL definitions and code. This symbolic constant has a
value of 0x4000.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_MAX_V2_1:  </b>This value and values
that exceed this value are not valid and MUST NOT be used by servers and
clients with schema version 0x0201 and earlier. It is defined for simplicity in
writing IDL definitions and code. This symbolic constant has a value of 0x0020.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_MAX_V2_9:  </b>This value and values
that exceed this value are not valid and MUST NOT be used by servers and
clients with schema version 0x0209 and earlier. It is defined for simplicity in
writing IDL definitions and code. This symbolic constant has a value of 0x0040.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_MAX_V2_10:  </b>This value and
values that exceed this value are not valid and MUST NOT be used by servers and
clients with schema version 0x020A and earlier. It is defined for simplicity in
writing IDL definitions and code. This symbolic constant has a value of 0x0400.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_MAX_V2_20:  </b>This value and
values that exceed this value are not valid and MUST NOT be used by servers and
clients with schema version 0x0214 and earlier. It is defined for simplicity in
writing IDL definitions and code. This symbolic constant has a value of 0x1000.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_LUA_CONDITIONAL_ACE:  </b>This flag
MUST be set if and only if the <b>wszLocalUserAuthorizationList</b> field of
the <span><a href="4f5bc5fd-4a3c-46a5-98dc-98b31b73aa89" data-linktype="relative-path">FW_RULE2_24</a></span>

versions 0x0200, 0x0201, 0x020A, 0x0214, and 0x0216, this value is invalid and
MUST NOT be used.</p><p><b>FW_RULE_FLAGS_BIND_TO_INTERFACE:</b> This flag is
not used.</p></div>
