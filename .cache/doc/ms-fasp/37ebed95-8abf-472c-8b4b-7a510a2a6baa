and MUST NOT be used. It is defined for simplicity in writing <span><a href="d891304d-92d8-4f9f-9e60-a1f02b28ae30#gt_73177eec-4092-420f-92c5-60b2478df824" data-linktype="relative-path">IDL</a></span>

the store that contains all the policies from the different <span><a href="d891304d-92d8-4f9f-9e60-a1f02b28ae30#gt_dec32233-8776-4151-91a0-8624a2b9abb0" data-linktype="relative-path">Group

store is persisted in the registry. It is downloaded by the <span><a href="d891304d-92d8-4f9f-9e60-a1f02b28ae30#gt_defe8c22-1365-4e5e-abf7-46ad112d3bda" data-linktype="relative-path">Group

and read by the firewall and advanced security components; therefore, it is a
read-only store. This symbolic constant has a value of 1.</p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_LOCAL:  </b>This value identifies
the store that contains the local host policy. This store is persisted in the
registry by the firewall and advanced security components; therefore, it is a
read/write store. This symbolic constant has a value of 2.</p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_NOT_USED_VALUE_3:  </b>This store is
currently not used over the wire. This symbolic constant has a value of 3.</p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_NOT_USED_VALUE_4:  </b>This store is
currently not used over the wire. This symbolic constant has a value of 4.</p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_DYNAMIC:  </b>This value identifies
the store that contains the effective policy, that is, the aggregated and
merged policy from all policy sources. Policy objects can be added and modified
on this store, but they are not persisted and will be lost the next time the
firewall and advanced security components initialize. Policy objects on this
store can be modified only if they were originally added to this store. This
symbolic constant has a value of 5.</p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_GPO:  </b>This value is not used on
the wire. This symbolic constant has a value of 6.</p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_DEFAULTS:  </b>This value identifies
the store that contains the defaults that the host operating system had
out-of-box. This store is persisted in the registry. It is written by the host
operating system setup. It is read by the firewall and advanced security
components when it is instructed to go back to the default out-of-box
configuration; hence it is a read-only store. This symbolic constant has a
value of 7.<b> </b></p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_NOT_USED_VALUE_8:  </b>This store is
currently not used over the wire. This symbolic constant has a value of 8.</p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_NOT_USED_VALUE_9:  </b>This store is
currently not used over the wire. This symbolic constant has a value of 9.</p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_NOT_USED_VALUE_10:  </b>This store
is currently not used over the wire. This symbolic constant has a value of 10.</p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_NOT_USED_VALUE_11:  </b>This store
is currently not used over the wire. This symbolic constant has a value of 11.</p><p><b>FW_STORE_TYPE_MAX:  </b>This value and values that
exceed this value are not valid and MUST NOT be used. This symbolic constant is
defined for simplicity in writing IDL definitions and code. It has a value of
8.</p></div>
