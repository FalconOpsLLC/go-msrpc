Provides a high-resolution (100 nanoseconds) time stamp that is more expensive
to retrieve.</p><p><b>plaSystem:  </b>System time. Provides a
low-resolution (10 milliseconds) time stamp that is less expensive to retrieve.
</p><p><b>plaCycle:  </b>CPU cycle counter. MAY provide the
highest resolution time stamp and is the least expensive to retrieve. However,
the CPU counter is unreliable and its use is not recommended.</p></div>
