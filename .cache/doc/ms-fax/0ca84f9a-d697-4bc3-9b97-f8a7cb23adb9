disconnected the fax call.</p><p><b>fjesINITIALIZING: </b>The device is initializing a
call.</p><p><b>fjesDIALING: </b>The device is dialing a fax
number.</p><p><b>fjesTRANSMITTING: </b>The device is sending a fax.</p><p><b>fjesANSWERED: </b>The device answered a new call.</p><p><b>fjesRECEIVING: </b>The device is receiving a fax.</p><p><b>fjesLINE_UNAVAILABLE: </b>The device is not
