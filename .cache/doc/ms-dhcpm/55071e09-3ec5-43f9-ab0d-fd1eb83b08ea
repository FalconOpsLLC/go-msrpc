<div class="content"><p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server
Management Protocol (DHCPM) defines remote procedure call (RPC) interfaces that
provide methods for remotely accessing and administering the DHCP server. This
RPC-based client/server protocol is used to configure, manage, and monitor a
DHCP server.</p><p>An application implementing this protocol can remotely
administer the DHCP server. This protocol enables service monitoring as well as
creating, updating, and deleting DHCP scopes and associated configuration
options; retrieving and setting DHCP server bindings; and retrieving and
creating DHCP client lease records.</p><p>Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are
normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are
informative.</p></div>
