relationship on the DHCPv4 server is in the initializing state.</p><p><b>STARTUP: </b>This value means that each server
participating in the failover relationship moves into the STARTUP state after
initializing itself. The STARTUP state enables a server to probe its <span><a href="a9d6a415-4de6-4058-befe-ca2e42764485#gt_a454a106-1b85-422c-84ea-9ce5bd6621b8" data-linktype="relative-path">partner

services <b>DHCPDISCOVER</b> messages <span><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90318" data-linktype="external">[RFC2131]</a></span> and
all other DHCP requests, other than <b>DHCPREQUEST</b>/<b>RENEWAL</b> or <b>DHCPREQUEST</b>/<b>REBINDING</b>

Each server services <b>DHCPREQUEST</b>/<b>RENEWAL</b> or <b>DHCPDISCOVER</b>/<b>REBINDING</b>
requests from any client.</p><p><b>COMMUNICATION_INT: </b>This value means that each
server in a failover relationship is operating independently in the
COMMUNICATION_INT state, but neither assumes that its partner is not operating.
The partner server might be operating and simply unable to communicate with
this server, or it might not be operating at all.</p><p><b>PARTNER_DOWN: </b>This value means that when
operating in the PARTNER_DOWN state, a server assumes that its partner is not
currently operating.</p><p><b>POTENTIAL_CONFLICT: </b>This value indicates that
the failover relationship between two DHCP servers is attempting to
re-establish itself.</p><p><b>CONFLICT_DONE: </b>This value indicates that
during the process where two servers in a failover relationship attempt
reintegration with each other, the <span><a href="a9d6a415-4de6-4058-befe-ca2e42764485#gt_bb76b8f0-0929-47c8-a06a-d3f9a8761d93" data-linktype="relative-path">primary server</a></span> has

two servers in a failover relationship were attempting reintegration with each
other in the POTENTIAL_CONFLICT state, but communications failed prior to
completion of the reintegration.</p><p><b>RECOVER: </b>This value indicates that a server in
a failover relationship has no information in its stable storage facility or
that it is reintegrating with a server in the PARTNER_DOWN state after it has
been down.</p><p><b>RECOVER_WAIT: </b>This value means that the DHCPv4
server waits for a time period equal to <span><a href="a9d6a415-4de6-4058-befe-ca2e42764485#gt_e4be91c7-4c7b-4b4a-8e14-813530d7c34f" data-linktype="relative-path">maximum client lead time (MCLT)</a></span>
