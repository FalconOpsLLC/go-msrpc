DHCP server assigns IP addresses, extends IP address leases, and releases
unused IP addresses for DHCP clients on this subnet.</p><p><b>DhcpSubnetDisabled: </b>The subnet is disabled;
the DHCP server does not assign IP addresses or extend IP address leases for
DHCP clients on this subnet. However, the DHCP server still releases unused IP
addresses for DHCP clients on this subnet.</p><p><b>DhcpSubnetEnabledSwitched: </b>The subnet is
enabled; the DHCP server assigns IP addresses, extends IP address leases, and
releases unused IP addresses for DHCP clients on this subnet. In addition, the
default gateway for the DHCP client is set to on-link route.</p><p><b>DhcpSubnetDisabledSwitched: </b>The subnet is
disabled; the DHCP server does not distribute addresses or extend leases within
the subnet range to clients. However, the DHCP server still releases addresses
within the subnet range. The system behavior in the DhcpSubnetDisabledSwitched
state is identical to the state described in DhcpSubnetDisabled. Any software
that uses the DHCPM API can use the DhcpSubnetDisabledSwitched state to
remember that a particular scope needs to be put into the
DhcpSubnetEnabledSwitched state when enabled.</p><p><b>DhcpSubnetInvalidState: </b>The subnet is not
valid, and hence no address will be distributed or extended.</p></div>
