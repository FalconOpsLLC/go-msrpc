<div class="content"><p> </p><p>The Remote Data Services (RDS) Transport Protocol is an
application-level protocol for distributed applications. RDS Transport Protocol
specifies a protocol allowing for the remote query and manipulation of data on
a remote server. To facilitate data operations, it specifies how a remote
method and its parameters are represented in an RDS message for transmission by
way of an HTTP request to a server for execution. It also specifies how the
results of an invoked method are represented in a message for transmission back
to the client by way of the HTTP response. Finally, it specifies the
data-centric messages used for data query and manipulation as well as their
associated <span><a href="844a944f-4f1a-48e9-af98-f71335bb714a#gt_6c5ab3d6-018e-494f-b232-d0ac7e108f6b" data-linktype="relative-path">RecordSets</a></span>.</p><p>The core data-centric messages used in an RDS Transport
Protocol server are as follows:</p><ul><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Execute - Provides a method to execute a complex SQL command and
return a RecordSet.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Query - Provides a method to execute a simple parameterless SQL
query command and return a RecordSet.</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Synchronize - Provides a method for an RDS Transport Protocol
client to synchronize data changes from the client to the server. </p>
</li></ul><p>The following diagram depicts a typical flow of
communication in the RDS Transport Protocol. The client uses Query to populate
a client-side RecordSet and uses data from the RecordSet for processing. The
client-side RecordSet tracks changes made to the data. Only these changes are
then transmitted back to the server.<a id="Appendix_A_Target_2"></a><a aria-label="Product behavior note 2" href="d634b3eb-6211-459f-8760-55e95edc9c5f#Appendix_A_2" data-linktype="relative-path">&lt;2&gt;</a></p><p><img id="MS-ADTG_pict64cde595-54dc-45b6-8c98-1aac37a5a015.png" src="ms-adtg_files/image001.png" alt="Communication flow in the RDS Transport Protocol" title="Communication flow in the RDS Transport Protocol" data-linktype="relative-path"/></p><p><b>Figure 1: Communication flow in the RDS Transport Protocol</b></p><p>For more information, refer to the following sections:</p><ul><li><p><span><span>

<p><b>Note</b>  The
RDS Transport Protocol was developed to support communication of tabular data
between systems; specifically, Microsoft used the RDS Transport Protocol in
early versions of Windows SharePoint Services. This method of transporting
tabular data has been superseded by SOAP and the Distributed Component Object
Model (DCOM), and is no longer used by Windows SharePoint Services. Microsoft
does not use the RDS Transport Protocol within the Windows operating systems.</p>
