on domain-joined systems and are started during boot. When a system is unjoined
from the domain, then the client and server are stopped and will not be started
during boot.</p><p>The following sections describe the scenarios in which this
protocol is used. It provides an overview about the general purpose of this
protocol and the flow of its operations.</p></div>
