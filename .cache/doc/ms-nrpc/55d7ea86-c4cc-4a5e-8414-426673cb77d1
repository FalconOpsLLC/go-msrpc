number of bytes of paged pool memory assigned to the user. The paged pool is an
area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for
objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used.</p><p><b>NonPagedPoolLimit:</b> A ULONG that specifies the
number of bytes of nonpaged pool memory assigned to the user. The nonpaged pool
is an area of system memory for objects that cannot be written to disk but MUST
remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.</p><p><b>MinimumWorkingSetSize:</b> A ULONG that specifies
the minimum set size assigned to the user. The working set of a process is the
set of memory pages currently visible to the process in physical RAM memory.
These pages are present in memory when the application is running and available
for an application to use without triggering a page fault.</p><p><b>MaximumWorkingSetSize:</b> A ULONG that specifies
the maximum set size assigned to the user.</p><p><b>PagefileLimit:</b> A ULONG that specifies the
maximum size, in bytes, of the paging file, which is a reserved space on disk
that backs up committed physical memory on the computer.</p><p><b>Reserved:</b> An <b>OLD_LARGE_INTEGER</b>
structure (<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=124152" data-linktype="external">[MSDN-OLI]</a>)
that is set to zero and ignored on receipt. </p></div>
