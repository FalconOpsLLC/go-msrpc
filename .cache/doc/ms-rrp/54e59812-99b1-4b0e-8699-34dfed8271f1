<div class="content"><p>The Windows Remote Registry Protocol is a client/server
protocol that is used for remotely managing a hierarchical <b>Data Store</b>
with lightly typed elements. The layout and specifics of such a store is
specified in section <a href="508e3d3e-1225-4075-be04-67680ea80497" data-linktype="relative-path">3.1.1</a>.
</p><p>A remote <a href="261b039d-95d9-4749-9680-db1851d03945#gt_2d67ea57-10e6-422f-985e-694834945a02" data-linktype="relative-path">registry</a>
management session begins with the client initiating the connection request to
the server. If the server grants the request, the connection is established.
The client can then make multiple requests to read or modify the registry on
the server by using the same session until the session is terminated.</p><p>A typical remote registry session involves the client
connecting to the server and requesting to open a registry <a href="261b039d-95d9-4749-9680-db1851d03945#gt_718bfd46-3cd2-45e8-befa-55f5c9f3be7b" data-linktype="relative-path">key</a> on the server. If the
server accepts the request, it responds with an <a href="261b039d-95d9-4749-9680-db1851d03945#gt_8a7f6700-8311-45bc-af10-82e10accd331" data-linktype="relative-path">RPC</a> context handle that
refers to the key. The client uses this RPC context handle to operate on that
key. This usually involves sending another request to the server specifying the
type of operation to perform and any specific parameters that are associated
with that operation. If the server accepts this request, it attempts to change
the state of the key based on the request and responds to the client with the
result of the operation. When the client is finished operating on the server
keys, it terminates the protocol by sending a request to close the RPC context
handle.</p></div>
