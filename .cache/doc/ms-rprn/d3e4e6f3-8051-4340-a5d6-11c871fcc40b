<div class="content"><p>The Print System Remote Protocol is a synchronous Remote
Procedure Call (RPC)-based protocol used by a print client to send print jobs
to a print server, to direct their processing, to add or remove print queues,
and to perform other print system management functions. </p><p>An enhanced replacement for this protocol is specified in
[MS-PAR] The Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol. It provides asynchronous
forms of the synchronous operations supported by the Print System Remote
Protocol and extends them with additional asynchronous operations. It also
provides for higher-level authentication in RPC calls between client and
server.</p><p>Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are
normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are
informative.</p></div>
