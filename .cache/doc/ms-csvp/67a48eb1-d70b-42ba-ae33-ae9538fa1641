0x00000000 and 0x00000064. Designates the reliability of communication on the
route measured by the server using implementation-specific mechanisms. A value
of 0x00000000 represents most reliable, and 0x00000064 designates least
reliable. A server sends a collection of network packets to the remote host and
measures the number of packets that are successfully delivered.</p><p><b>status:</b>  The status of the
communication route.</p></div>
