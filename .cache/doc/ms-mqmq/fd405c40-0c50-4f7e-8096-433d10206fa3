sequence. There is a local-to-remote and remote-to-local sequence. These
message sequences exist for the lifetime of the session. The local and remote
protocols MUST maintain counts of the UserMessage Packets sent and received. A
message MUST be associated with a sequence number that corresponds to its
position within the sequence. Sequence numbers MUST begin with 1 and MUST
increment by 1 with each subsequent message. For example, the third message
sent on a session has a sequence number of 3.</p><p>The protocols MUST also maintain a count of recoverable
UserMessage Packets sent and associates recoverable sequence numbers with those
messages. For example, the fifth recoverable message sent on a session has a
sequence number of 5.</p><table>

number is specified in the <b>RecoverableMsgAckSeqNumber</b> field. A given bit
k of this field represents a recoverable UserMessage Packet with a sequence
number of <b>RecoverableMsgAckSeqNumber</b> + k. The corresponding bit for a
