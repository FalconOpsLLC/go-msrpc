protocol that is used for remotely managing a <a href="694e5e7a-5833-4f3d-b47e-323ee1d452c2#gt_acd8b49c-8762-48fd-9272-26a03643322b" data-linktype="relative-path">failover cluster</a>. Managing
a failover cluster involves managing the data that represents the configuration
of the <a href="694e5e7a-5833-4f3d-b47e-323ee1d452c2#gt_feef37b3-c173-4f51-aab6-b55a6366259b" data-linktype="relative-path">cluster</a>, the
entities that constitute the cluster, and the applications and services that
run in a cluster. For example, the ClusAPI Protocol is used to determine the
version of the cluster and to read and write data in the <a href="694e5e7a-5833-4f3d-b47e-323ee1d452c2#gt_13de67f6-ac9d-491f-8dfb-12601a8b0838" data-linktype="relative-path">cluster registry</a>. This
protocol is also used to determine whether a computer system is currently
acting as a member of a failover cluster. Lastly, the ClusAPI Protocol is used
to control and query a service or application that is hosted by a failover
cluster.</p><p>Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are
