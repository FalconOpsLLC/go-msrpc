<div class="content"><p> </p><p>The event information returned by the query and subscription
methods is in a binary format named BinXml. BinXml is a token representation of
text XML 1.0, as specified in <span><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=90600" data-linktype="external">[XML10]</a></span>. </p><p>Here BinXml encodes an XML document so that the original XML
text can be correctly reproduced from the encoding. There is no requirement for
a server to use or understand the text XML. The protocol can be implemented end
to end by treating BinXml as a method to transmit name-value pairs, instead of
as an encoding of XML. However, after the data has been received, it is common
for third-party applications to convert from binary XML to text XML independent
of the protocol. Therefore, for informative purposes only, an overview of the
relationship is provided. </p><p>Note that this translation is not required by either the
client or the server in this protocol.</p><p>What follows is a greatly simplified example of a fragment
of text XML encoding in binary XML.</p><table><thead>

meaning. </p><dl>
<dd>
<div><pre> 00 - eof
 01 - open start tag
 02 - close start tag
 04 - end tag
 05 - value text
</pre></div>
</dd></dl><p>BinXml also includes more information that allows for fast
navigation of the XML. For example, lengths of elements and attribute lists
allow the user to jump forward in the BinXml stream. Another example is that
BinXml encoding of Names includes length and hash values that allow for fast
comparisons of the XML names.</p></div>
