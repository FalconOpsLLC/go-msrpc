<div class="content"><p>To effectively manage systems, administrators need the
capability to query for <a href="da82a046-4e10-46ab-8da9-3d24bb48a2b2#gt_35645a67-9e0b-4c05-b2d9-3b2b25f2beac" data-linktype="relative-path">performance
counter</a> data on the health or state of a particular application or system.
Software components that are designed with performance counters are therefore
easier to manage and diagnose. The Performance Counter Query Protocol enables
system administrators to query performance counters on a remote server.</p><p>The Performance Counter Query Protocol is used to retrieve
performance counter information from a server. The protocol allows a client to
enumerate the performance counters that are available on the server. The server
can use the protocol to return performance counter information, such as
localized counter names and description strings, performance counter types (for
more information, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89980" data-linktype="external">[MSDN-COUNT]</a>),
and instance information if there are multiple instances of a performance
counter. The client can also use the protocol to establish a query on the
server and add or remove performance counters to it. The client can then
repeatedly retrieve performance counter data that is associated with the query
by using the protocol.</p></div>
