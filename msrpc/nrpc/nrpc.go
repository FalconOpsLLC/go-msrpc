// The nrpc package implements the NRPC client protocol.
//
// # Introduction
//
// The Netlogon Remote Protocol is a remote procedure call (RPC) interface that is used
// for user and machine authentication on domain-based networks. The Netlogon Remote
// Protocol RPC interface is also used to replicate the database for backup domain controllers
// (BDCs).
//
// The Netlogon Remote Protocol is used to maintain domain relationships from the members
// of a domain to the domain controller (DC), among DCs for a domain, and between DCs
// across domains. This RPC interface is used to discover and manage these relationships.
//
// # Overview
//
// The Netlogon Remote Protocol is used for secure communication between machines in
// a domain and domain controllers (DCs) (both domain members and DCs). The communication
// is secured by using a shared session key computed between the client and the DC that
// is engaged in the secure communication. The session key is computed by using a preconfigured
// shared secret that is known to the client and the DC.
//
// The Netlogon Remote Protocol client and server can only run on domain-joined systems
// and are started during boot. When a system is unjoined from the domain, then the
// client and server are stopped and will not be started during boot.
//
// The following sections describe the scenarios in which this protocol is used. It
// provides an overview about the general purpose of this protocol and the flow of its
// operations.
