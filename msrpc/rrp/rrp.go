// The rrp package implements the RRP client protocol.
//
// # Introduction
//
// The Windows Remote Registry Protocol is a remote procedure call (RPC)â€“based client/server
// protocol that is used for remotely managing a hierarchical Data Store such as the
// Windows registry. For more information, see [MSWINREG].
//
// # Overview
//
// The Windows Remote Registry Protocol is a client/server protocol that is used for
// remotely managing a hierarchical Data Store with lightly typed elements. The layout
// and specifics of such a store is specified in section 3.1.1.
//
// A remote registry management session begins with the client initiating the connection
// request to the server. If the server grants the request, the connection is established.
// The client can then make multiple requests to read or modify the registry on the
// server by using the same session until the session is terminated.
//
// A typical remote registry session involves the client connecting to the server and
// requesting to open a registry key on the server. If the server accepts the request,
// it responds with an RPC context handle that refers to the key. The client uses this
// RPC context handle to operate on that key. This usually involves sending another
// request to the server specifying the type of operation to perform and any specific
// parameters that are associated with that operation. If the server accepts this request,
// it attempts to change the state of the key based on the request and responds to the
// client with the result of the operation. When the client is finished operating on
// the server keys, it terminates the protocol by sending a request to close the RPC
// context handle.
