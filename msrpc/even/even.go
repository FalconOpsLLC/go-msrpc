// The even package implements the EVEN client protocol.
//
// # Introduction
//
// The EventLog Remoting Protocol is an RPC-based protocol that exposes remote procedure
// call (RPC) methods for reading events in both live event logs and backup event logs
// on remote computers. The protocol also specifies how to get general information on
// a log, such as the number of records in the log, the oldest records in the log, and
// if the log is full. The protocol can also be used for clearing and backing up both
// types of event logs.
//
// Note  Early releases of the EventLog Remoting Protocol have never been assigned a
// version number. However, newer releases of the EventLog Remoting Protocol have version
// numbers. For example, the version released with Windows Vista operating system is
// version 6.0.
