// The pcq package implements the PCQ client protocol.
//
// # Introduction
//
// The Performance Counter Query Protocol is a remote procedure call (RPC)â€“based protocol
// that is used for browsing performance counters and retrieving performance counter
// values from a server.
//
// # Overview
//
// To effectively manage systems, administrators need the capability to query for performance
// counter data on the health or state of a particular application or system. Software
// components that are designed with performance counters are therefore easier to manage
// and diagnose. The Performance Counter Query Protocol enables system administrators
// to query performance counters on a remote server.
//
// The Performance Counter Query Protocol is used to retrieve performance counter information
// from a server. The protocol allows a client to enumerate the performance counters
// that are available on the server. The server can use the protocol to return performance
// counter information, such as localized counter names and description strings, performance
// counter types (for more information, see [MSDN-COUNT]), and instance information
// if there are multiple instances of a performance counter. The client can also use
// the protocol to establish a query on the server and add or remove performance counters
// to it. The client can then repeatedly retrieve performance counter data that is associated
// with the query by using the protocol.
